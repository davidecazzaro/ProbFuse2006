# ProbFuse2006

This is the project for the Information Retrieval course at Unipd.
The work is split in two parts:
  - Reimplement the basic "comb" techniques following Fox and Shaw  "Combination of Multiple Searches" paper. We also normalize the scores following Lee "Combining Multiple Evidence from Different Properties of Weighting Schemes" (1995).
  - Implement an advanced fusion ranking technique, we choose the ProbFuse2006 paper, and study the reproducibility of the paper.

# How to use
  - Use Python3
  - Create a folder in input/ called _ten_models_. Inside this folder we expect the ten run generated with Terrier of ten differente IRS. So in the folder ten_models/ we have ten folders named run1, run2, up to run10, and each of those folder have at least the .res file generated by Terrier.
  - Run `python3 combine.py` to execute the first part of the project. This will read the 10 runs, normalize the scores and aggregate the run using the different fusion ranking techniques: combMNZ, combMAX, combMIN, combSUM, combANZ, combMED.
  - The resulting runs are saved in the output/ folder
